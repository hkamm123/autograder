 * An in-memory model that reports the decisions, a few key details,
 * and some debug information from the Commit Verification System.
 *
 * @see edu.byu.cs.model.Submission.ScoreVerification#verifiedStatus() for more information about `penaltyPct`.
 *
 * @param verified Officially reports the verified status of the submission.
 * @param isCachedResponse Whether this was freshly generated, or passed through from a previous decision.
 * @param totalCommits Total number of relevant commits analyzed. Excludes merges and commits before the tail threshold.
 * @param significantCommits Total number of commits above the minimum line threshold.
 * @param numDays The number of unique days with commits. Insignificant commits contribute to this number.
 * @param missingTail Error flag indicates when a tail hash was expected but not found during evaluation.
 * @param penaltyPct A reduction to the phase, if any, when a TA approved an unapproved score. [0-100]
 * @param failureMessage A string that will be presented to the use when this the result is not verified.
 * @param warningMessages A nullable, potentially empty collection of warning messages that should be presented to the user.
 * @param minAllowedThreshold Debug purposes. The min timestamp considered.
 * @param maxAllowedThreshold Debug. The maximum timestamp considered.
 * @param headHash Debug. The head hash evaluated. Not null.
 * @param tailHash Debug. The tail hash evaluated. Sometimes null.

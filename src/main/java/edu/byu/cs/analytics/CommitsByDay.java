 * Contains the results of a commit analytics parse,

 * <br>
 * This data structure is intended for use <i>only</i> within the system processing memory.
 * It is not intended to be persisted in a database or other data structure.
 *
 * @param dayMap Represents each of the calendar days,
 *               with the number of commits on that day.
 * @param changesPerCommit One entry for each commit processed, representing the number of lines changed in the commit.
 * @param erroringCommits Reports commit hashes that triggered any of the failure conditions,
 *                        grouped by a natural key into the kinds of conditions that they failed.
 *                        This will be empty when there are no erroring commits.
 * @param totalCommits The total number of commits processed, excluding merge commits.
 * @param mergeCommits The total number of merge commits.
 * @param commitsInOrder Reports whether all commits were authored strictly after their parents.
 * @param commitsInPast Reports whether any commits were found before the tail hash chronologically.
 *                      This flag has been deemed unhelpful and intentionally ignored.
 *                      Therefore, these are NOT counted as erroring commits.
 * @param commitsInFuture Reports whether any commits were found after the end point chronologically.
 * @param commitsBackdated Reports whether any commit was detected to have been backdated.
 * @param commitTimestampsDuplicated Reports where any two commits were discovered to have the same timestamp.
 * @param missingTailHash Reports when a tail hash was expected to exist, but the commit could not be found.
 * @param lowerThreshold The {@link CommitThreshold}, exclusive.
 * @param upperThreshold The {@link CommitThreshold}, inclusive.

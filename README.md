## Deployment

Before running the server, the `src/main/resources/frontend/.env.dev` configuration file needs to match your
environment (the default may be sufficient). It should contain the URL of the backend.

### Docker

For a docker deployment, run one of the following commands:

```bash
# For a deployment with a MySQL database included
docker compose --profile with-db up -d
```

```bash
# For a deployment requiring an external MySQL database
docker compose up -d
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using the docker MySQL database, ensure that in
> `src/main/resources/db.properties` the property `db.url` is set to `db:3306`.
